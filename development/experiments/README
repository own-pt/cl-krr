This directory contains various experiments created to assess the
correcteness of the SUO-KIF -> TPTP transformation. 

Notes on E (email exchange with Stephan Schulz):

Hi Stephan,

here's another interesting behavior.  We are working on a new
translator from SUMO to TPTP (https://github.com/own-pt/cl-krr) and
are using E 1.9 to verify our conversion.

We are finding out that, in certain cases --auto will make E *not*
find a proof, after even waiting for more than one hour, where as
using E with defaults does find one in less than one or two minutes.

Specifically, the following line works:

$ eprover -s --proof-object --tptp3-format
--delete-bad-limit=9048000000 auto.tptp

whereas:

$ eprover -s --auto --proof-object --tptp3-format
--delete-bad-limit=9048000000 auto.tptp

Do you know why this might be the case?

In general, the Auto mode is only a heuristic. It works great _on average_,
but not for all problems. In particular, the auto mode will sometimes use
Eâ€™s variant SInE, which may prune away something important ;-).

There are some things you can try:

First, and simplest, use --auto-schedule instead of --auto - it will try
several things, one after the other. To help the scheduler, give it a
maximum time limit (otherwise it will assume 5 minutes).

Secondly, try -xAuto -tAuto instead of --auto. That will run auto-mode,
but without SInE.
