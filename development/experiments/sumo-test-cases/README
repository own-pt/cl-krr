Directories here contain experiments derived from the SUMO test cases
present at sumo/tests.  They were adapted to our conversion process,
and ran through the E and Vampire ATPs. 

How to execute provers (E and Vampire):

time nice E/PROVER/eprover -s --auto-schedule --proof-object --tptp3-format --delete-bad-limit=9048000000
time nice E/PROVER/eprover -s --auto --proof-object --tptp3-format --delete-bad-limit=9048000000
time nice E/PROVER/eprover -s --proof-object --tptp3-format --delete-bad-limit=9048000000
time nice Vampire---4.0/vampire --mode casc -m 20000 -t 6h

All the examples were generated with the core-sumo.kif in this
directory (which is merge+milo + some contradictions removed). 

;; example:
(compile-suo-kif :in-files '("core-sumo.kif" "reasoning.kif") :tptp t)

NOTE: CL-KRR does not support QUERY yet, so you need to update the QUERY TPTP line to switch to a conjecture.

For example:

/*
(QUERY (MEETSSPATIALLY OBJECT16-2 OBJECT16-3))
*/

Generated:

fof(a229665,axiom,s_QUERY(s_MEETSSPATIALLY(s_OBJECT16_2, s_OBJECT16_3))).

Fixed:

fof(a229665,conjecture,s_MEETSSPATIALLY(s_OBJECT16_2, s_OBJECT16_3)).
