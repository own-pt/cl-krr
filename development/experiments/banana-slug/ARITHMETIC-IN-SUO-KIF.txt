For once I have question that is only borderline related to our
transformation. :-)

I started exploring exhaustiveDecomposition, disjointDecomposition and
follow their implementation in terms of inList, ListOrderFn,
ListLengthFn, etc.  to try to understand the failure to prove the
banana slug.

ListLengthFn, for instance is defined like:

(forall (@ROW ?ITEM)
  (equal
    (ListLengthFn (ListFn @ROW ?ITEM))
    (SuccessorFn (ListLengthFn (ListFn @ROW)))))

and SuccessorFn is defined as:

(forall (?NUMBER)
  (equal (SuccessorFn ?NUMBER) (AdditionFn ?NUMBER 1)))

Where it's Sigma translation is:

fof(kb_SUMO_4453,axiom,(
    ! [NUMBER] :
      ( s_instance(NUMBER,s_Integer)
     => s_SuccessorFn(NUMBER) = plus(NUMBER,1) ) )).

So AdditionFn was translated to plus, but unless I'm missing
something, plus is not a TPTP-FOF predefined function.

I also don't see any reference to plus in the E documentation.

Looking at the TPTP site, it looks like arithmetic is defined for TFF
and THF only ($sum, etc.)?

Clearly I'm missing something... unless we are doing some form of
Peano arithmetic in SUMO that I'm not seeing?

Cheers,
Fabricio

Hi Fabricio,
   The old KIF-Vampire had the four arithmetic functions but not E.  So 
your right we have some basic Peano arithmetic axioms as a last resort, 
but it's not all coherently implemented and doesn't work.  I know Geoff 
had some proposals for arithmetic in TPTP but I haven't followed them 
and whether or how they were implemented.  I'd love to have a 
translation that took advantage of them, if they exist.  And this is why 
I've suggested that if you're interested in SNARK you might connect with 
its arithmetic functions.

Yes, I haven't answered yet the other thread with Valeria but the SNARK =
ability to handle  procedural attachments is one of the indeed features =
that we take into consideration when we started to play with it.

In the case of SNARK, however, thing get more complicated since I would =
expect to think about a more direct translation from SUMO to SNARK =
language not via TPTP.

More problems, more fun!=20

Best,
